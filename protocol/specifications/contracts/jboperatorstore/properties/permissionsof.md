**The permissions that an operator has to operate on a specific domain.**

_An account can give an operator permissions that only pertain to a specific domain. There is no domain with a value of 0 – accounts can use the 0 domain to give an operator permissions to all domains on their behalf. Applications can specify their own domain system._

_Permissions are stored in a packed `uint256`. Each 256 bits represents the on/off state of a permission. Applications can specify the significance of each index._

* `_operator` is the address of the operator.
* `_account` is the address of the account being operated.
* `_domain` is the domain within which the permissions apply.
* The resulting view function can be accessed externally by anyone.
* The resulting function overrides a function definition from the `IJBOperatorStore` interface.
